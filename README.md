# CSS-NOTES

This project serves as my personal collection of notes and practical exercises for mastering CSS Flexbox. 

It's a hands-on manual designed for my own learning, providing clear explanations and examples to build flexible and responsive layouts for my web projects. I use it for practice, reference, and continuous improvement.
